I'm an artist at just to make that clear and I work with scientists and engineers to sort of imagine different kinds of future ,17.9,26.95,2
and make videos talking about these possible futures based on the technology I work with the foot first project I'm going to talk to you about is a project that %HESITATION I did to explore these some oftentimes controversial and a strange with the relationship between science ethics and mythology and religion ,27.76,51.27,2
so %HESITATION ,52.08,52.82,0
I wonder how many of you have heard of the mythology a red string of fate in this regard yeah it's a very famous mythology in China and Japan that says that two people destined to meet each other romantically has this red string of fate in between them ,53.63,71.74,2
and we all think that's a very mystical faith right but as announces I wanted to work with scientists to see whether it's possible to recreate such a mythology the red string of fate so the video you see here this is a technology developed by professor Hideki says it's it and he developed the technology to genetically engineered silkworms so by adding the DNA of jelly fish and coral into so crowns the silkworms eyes glow red green and also the silk glows red and green so basically by adding different kinds of DNA is able to produce so farms that produce different kinds of silk so I asked him can you add a DNA that produces oxytocin and oxytocin is well known as a social bonding love home and actually he said yes that's possible we could add a DNA that produces oxytocin in the silk also DNA that produces %HESITATION R. R. F. P. red fluorescent protein and we made we actually genetically engineered a so cramped that produces oxytocin and the silk clothes read when we were doing this project we went to speak with condom use in trying the real mythology expects obviously and it's a very very old shrine in Tokyo thirteen hundred years old and the very known for producing these I. T. protection spirits so these protect your computers from viruses and crashes ,72.68,162.07,2
it's interesting how people often think science and religion goes against each other right that I grew up in Japan where shrines produce spirits like this to present your computers from crashes so I wanted to just do a project that shows %HESITATION a diverse perspective on %HESITATION science I it's not necessarily going against religion is sometimes could go like murders with religion ,164.53,192.8,2

okay so if you want to see the rest of the film if you go on YouTube and search Sputnik out red string of fate you'll you'll find the rest of the story thank you very much ,313.18,322.12,0 and 2
